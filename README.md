Credit card fraud detection using machine learning leverages algorithms to analyze transaction patterns and identify unusual or suspicious behavior in real time. By applying techniques like classification, anomaly detection, and clustering, ML models can significantly reduce false positives while improving the accuracy of detecting fraudulent activities. This enhances financial security and helps banks minimize losses.
